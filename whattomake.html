          <h2>Conceptual Model</h2>
          <div class="col-md-12 mt-20">The motivation for WhatToMake Ontology came from our observation of the pains of
            using traditional cookbooks or even some online recipe archives to find recipes that fit a given person’s
            requirements. We felt that in order to make that experience better, a user should have the ability to search
            for a wide range of parameters such as ingredients, cook time, course type, and meal type and have recipes
            that fulfilled those parameters returned to them. We also saw that recipe searching was difficult if a user
            had some form of allergy, health concern, or dietary restriction. We wanted to create something which would
            help the user not only enter those restrictions but to help them find adequate substitutes for the
            ingredients that they have restricted in the event that was necessary. These were the driving problems that
            influenced our design of WhatToMake Ontology.
            In creating this ontology, we set out to relate recipes and their ingredients in a way that allows users to
            query the system and get results that would accommodate different requirements. Some of these requirements
            have to do with the meal or course type or the preparation time of a recipe, while others have to do with
            allergies and substitution requests. We thus needed to model our ontology in a way that would allow us to
            efficiently answer these types of questions. Our ontology is made up of several major classes: food,
            ingredient, recipe, characteristic, user, course, and meal. These classes can be seen in the overview
            diagram below.</div>
            <br>
          <div class="col-md-8 mt-20">
            This diagram illustrates how the classes (denoted by green rectangles) are related to each other through
            object properties (denoted by the red rectangles). The data properties for each class are represented by the
            yellow rectangles. In some cases, there is a limited set of individuals used to represent different meals or
            courses. These individuals are shown as purple circles.

          <div class="col-md-8 mt-20">This piece of the concept diagram illustrates the relationship that the Recipe
            class has with other classes and properties. The recipe class has individuals that represent specific
            recipes. Each recipe individual has three data properties: hasCookTime, hasCookingTemprature, and serves.
            Each recipe individual also has however many hasIngredient relations with ingredient individuals. Each
            recipe has at least one Meal and Course that it is recommended for. Each ingredient individual has a boolean
            data property hasGluten to indicate whether this ingredient contains gluten and a data property
            hasGlycemicIndex that stores the glycemic index value for this ingredient.

            ingredient can have the relations hasFlavor and/or hasTexture, which represent the flavor and texture of
            this ingredient. This can help us when trying to make substitutions for ingredients. The flavors and
            textures themselves are represented as individuals.

            Ingredients/Recipes. A user (which is represented as an individual) can have a “dislikes,” “forbids,” or
            “isAllergicTo” relationship with an ingredient. This makes it so the user doesn’t have to input this
            information into the system every time. The user can also save recipes, which is represented by the
            “hasSaved” relation so that any recipes this user particularly likes can be easily displayed.

          <div class="col-md-8 mt-20">In addition to the ingredient class (which is used to indicate which individuals
            are ingredients), there is a separate hierarchy to classify these ingredients as foods. The top level
            element is “Food” and serves as the superclass for all food classifications. The classes represented in blue
            are existing classes that were imported from the EBI Food Ontology and the classes represented in green are
            additions made to improve the classification. This diagram does not represent all of the imported classes,
            but rather shows a representative set of those classes that are most relevant to the competency questions.

        <h2>Competency Questions &amp; Queries</h2>
                    <p>The functionality of the WhatToMake system can be demonstrated through the four competency questions that
                      were devised in order to develop the ontology. Each question aims to target a specific functionality of
                      the WhatToMake ontology, as explained below. Some questions include sample SPARQL queries, which can be
                      run by loading the ontology into Protege. To do so, load the <a
                        href="http://purl.org/heals/ingredient">http://purl.org/heals/ingredient</a> ontology by URL into
                      Protege and execute the queries in the SPARQL Query tab. Note that the food and foodon ontology components
                      are imported as a part of the ingredient ontology.</p>
                    <p><strong>1) "What recipes contain beef?"</strong><br />
                      This question targets the ontology's ability to query the system for recipes that contain a single
                      incredient, beef. An example SPARQL query for this question is shown below.

                      This question allows a user to specify which ingredients the would like to include while also specifying
                      those to exclude. This kind of question is especially relevant in cases of allergies, intolerances, and
                      dislikes. An example SPARQL query for this question is shown below.

                      This question addresses the use case of accomodating nutritional-based recommendations. This kind of
                      question would be ideal for a diabetic user who must reduct their sugar intake. Currently, the ontology
                      encodes nutritional information related to sugar by using glycemic index values. An example SPARQL query
                      for this question is shown below.

                    This question utilizes the hierarchical nature of the food classification to exclude certain classes of ingredients based on where they fall in the hierarchy.

Currently, there is no SPARQL query for this question.
